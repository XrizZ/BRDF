        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
                In order to build a BRDF Scanner, several components are needed. What we alredy have is a 
				DAVID Laserscanner, constisting of a reference pattern, a webcam and a line laser. This 
				gives us a 3D representation in form of an obj file. What is missing is a moveable light source
				in order to create different lighting conditions, covering a wide range of possible values in
				the BRD equation. We chose to integrate the light source into a scanner skeleton, which is 
				described in detail in the <a href="hardware.html">Implementation &ndash; Hardware</a> section. Once measurements are taken, we have
				discrete values for certain angles, so we need a software that calculates and may render a full
				BRDF. The latter is described in the <a href="software.html">Implementation &ndash; Software</a> section.
